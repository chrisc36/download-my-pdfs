# Download My Pdfs
Small python script that parses an HTML file containing bookmarks, as is exported by Google Chrome, and downloads all the PDFs links it finds into a subdirectory that mirrors the bookmarkâ€™s directory structure.

## Uses
Mainly useful for researchers who have a habit of bookmarking academic papers and then find themselves wanting to downloaded the bookmarked papers so they are available offline, or so they can be uploaded in reference manager like Mendeley without have to click the download button a bunch of times and re-organizing the resulting files.
